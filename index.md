<!-- this is an html comment -->

> ## Prerequisites
>
> The intended target audience of this lesson are [REFRACT](http://refract-rise.eu) secondees or PhD students interested in learning
> more about repeat proteins and the pipelines for their annotation. A specific background on bioinformatics is 
> not required, although it is necessary to be familiar with the concepts of protein sequence, structure and 
> folding. In addition, the role of proteins in protein-protein interaction network will be discussed in relationship 
> to their functions.
