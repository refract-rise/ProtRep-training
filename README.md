# Repeat proteins, explained
Training material on protein repeats

[![Open Source Love](https://badges.frapsoft.com/os/v2/open-source.png?v=103)](https://github.com/ellerbrock/open-source-badge/) 

This repository generates the corresponding [lesson website](https://refract-rise.github.io/repeat-proteins-training/), 
according to styles and recommentations from 
[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/). 

## Overview

Lesson development for training in Tandem Repeat proteins is based on four simple recommendations 
[1](https://f1000research.com/articles/6-876/v1). We are adopting the Open Source philosophy and policy for developing 
and maintaning training material to help us in providing clear guidelines on how to annotate repeat proteins.
1. Make source code publicly accessible from day one
1. Adopt a licence and comply with the licence of third-party dependencies
1. Define clear and transparent contribution, governance and communication processes
1. Make software easy to discover by providing software metadata via a popular community registry
