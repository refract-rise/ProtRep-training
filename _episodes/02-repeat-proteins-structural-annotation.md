title: "Repeat proteins structural annotation"
teaching: 120
exercises: 60
questions:
- "How do we annotate repeated regions in proteins from structure?"
objectives:
- "Define Tandem Repeat structures, regions and units."
- "Classify TR structure at the class level."
- "Understand the relationship between the unit structure, the repeat region arrangement and its function."
- "Visualize PDBs mapped on UniProt entries in the rcsPDB interface."
- "Use and edit PDB files."
- "Visualize and color PDB structures with Pymol."
- "Navigate RepeatsDB interface"
- "Use RepeatsDB-lite interface to show prediction results."
- "Edit repeat annotation using RepeatsDB-lite."
keypoints:
- "First key point."

> If the shape of an individual data file is `(60, 40)` (60 rows and 40

> > ## Solution
> > The shape will be `(60, 39)` because there is one fewer difference between
